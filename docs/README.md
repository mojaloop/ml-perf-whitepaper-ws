## Primary Documentation

The main documentation lives within each phase:
- Troubleshooting guides are in each phase's TROUBLESHOOTING.md
- Architecture decisions are documented where they're implemented
- Security guides are with the security implementation

This follows the Netflix principle of keeping documentation close to its context.
