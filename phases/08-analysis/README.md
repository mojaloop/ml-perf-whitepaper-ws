## üéØ Recommendations

Based on the analysis:

### For Production Deployment:
1. **Database**: Increase connection pool to 200
2. **Services**: Add replicas based on usage patterns
3. **Monitoring**: Set alerts at 80% of breaking point
4. **Capacity**: Plan for 1,500 TPS max (safety margin)

### For Higher Scale:
1. **2,000 TPS**: Add database read replicas
2. **5,000 TPS**: Implement service mesh optimization
3. **10,000 TPS**: Consider event streaming architecture

### Tuning Insights (If Multiple Iterations)

```bash
# Generate tuning insights report
./generate-tuning-insights.sh

# Produces insights like:
Key Tuning Insights
===================
1. Infrastructure scaling provided 38% improvement
   ‚Üí Indicates CPU-bound initially
   
2. Service scaling provided 30% improvement
   ‚Üí ML-API-Adapter was primary bottleneck
   
3. Database tuning provided final 26%
   ‚Üí Connection pooling was limiting factor

RECOMMENDATION: For similar deployments, start with:
- 20 nodes minimum (not 15)
- ML-API-Adapter at 20 replicas (not 12)
- Database connections at 300 (not 100)

This would likely achieve 1000 TPS on first attempt.
